**Title:** Contribution-Based Rewards and Progress Tracking
**As a:** frequent Mavito contributor (e.g. user who submits suggestions or comments),
**I want:** to earn points, unlock badges, and track my contribution progress,
**So that:** I feel motivated to participate and can see recognition for my efforts.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. **Points for Contribution:**

    - **Then** I earn points based on the type and quality of the contribution.
2. **Achievement Unlocking:**
    - **Given** I reach a milestone,
    - **Then** I unlock a badge or achievement.
3. **Progress Dashboard:**
    - **Given** I navigate to my profile,
    - **Then** I can view my total points, badges earned, and contribution rank.
4. **Real-Time Feedback:**
    - **Given** I perform a gamified action,
    - **Then** I receive instant feedback such as a pop up message.
5. **Leveling Up:**
    - **Given** I reach predefined thresholds,
    - **Then** my user rank or title updates accordingly.
6. **Offline Support:**
