# User Story #4: Multilingual Interface Support

**ID:** US004 (Mavito Project)  

**Title:** Support for Multiple Languages in User Interface  

**As a:** Mavito application user (e.g., language enthusiast, NLP researcher, student) who speaks one of South Africa's 12 official languages,  

**I want:** the application interface to be available in my preferred language,  

**So that:** I can navigate and interact with the app comfortably without language barriers.  

---

## Acceptance Criteria:  

1. **Language Selection:**  
   - [ ] **Given** I open the Mavito application for the first time,  
   - [ ] **Then** the app prompts me to select my preferred language from a list of supported languages (e.g., isiZulu, Afrikaans, English, etc.).  
   - [ ] **And** the selected language is saved as my default for future sessions.  

2. **Dynamic Language Switching:**  
   - [ ] **Given** I am using the app in my default language,  
   - [ ] **And** I navigate to the settings menu,  
   - [ ] **Then** I can switch to another supported language at any time.  
   - [ ] **And** the interface updates immediately to reflect the new language choice.  

3. **Localized Content Display:**  
   - [ ] **Given** I have selected a non-English language (e.g., Sesotho),  
   - [ ] **Then** all menus, buttons, labels, and system messages are displayed in the chosen language.  
   - [ ] **And** the app respects right-to-left (RTL) or other language-specific formatting if applicable.  

4. **Fallback for Untranslated Content:**  
   - [ ] **Given** a piece of text has not been translated into my selected language,  
   - [ ] **Then** the app displays the English version as a fallback.  
   - [ ] **And** logs the missing translation for future localization efforts.  

5. **Offline Language Support:**  
   - [ ] **Given** I am offline,  
   - [ ] **Then** the app retains my language preferences and displays all available localized content without requiring an internet connection.  

6. **User Contribution to Translations (Optional Enhancement):**  
   - [ ] **Given** I notice a missing or incorrect translation,  
   - [ ] **Then** I can submit a suggested correction or addition via a dedicated feedback option.  
   - [ ] **And** the suggestion is sent to the central repository for moderation and inclusion.

### Notes/Assumptions:  
- This user story assumes that translations for supported languages will be stored in a centralized repository and downloaded as part of the lexicon data sync process (aligned with US001).  
- Initial implementation may focus on a subset of high-priority languages, with others added incrementally.  
- RTL support is out of scope for the initial version but could be added later for languages like Arabic if needed.  
- The app's core functionality (e.g., search, data display) remains unchanged regardless of the selected interface language.
