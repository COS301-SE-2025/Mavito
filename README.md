## Project Description
**Marito** is a progressive web application (PWA) developed for the COS 301 Capstone project at the University of Pretoria. It serves as a unified platform for accessing, browsing, and contributing to multilingual glossaries, dictionaries, and terminology banks. Designed with an offline-first approach and scalable architecture, Mavito aims to support South Africa’s low-resource languages and empower linguistic research, NLP development, and language preservation.

## Git Structure & Branching Strategy

#### **Repository Type**: Monorepo
#### **Structure**:

```
/frontend       → React + TypeScript UI  
/backend        → Python FastAPI backend  
/Documentation  → Design and documentation  
/.github        → GitHub Actions workflows and configuration  
```

#### **GitFlow Branching Model**
  * `main` – Stable, production-ready code
  * `develop` – Active development integration branch
  * `feature/*` – New features and enhancements
  * `release/*` – Pre-release testing and stabilization
  * `hotfix/*` – Critical fixes applied directly to production

This structure ensures clean separation between environments, supports parallel feature development, and maintains a stable deployment process. All code changes are merged into `develop` through pull requests, and releases are carefully tested before merging into `main`.
